<<<<<<< HEAD
Scrum is an agile process that allows teams to deliver highest quality product or services in the shortest time.
It employs iterative development cycle that is repeated after every two/four weeks (sprints) in which the service or product is rapidly developed and tested.
There are three roles in scrum process 1. Product Owner 2. Scrum Master 3.Development Team
1.Product Owner
- had the global overview of the product/service
-creates and prioritizes the product backlog which is nothing but the requirements
-understands the customerâ€™s needs and the business value

2.Scrum Master
- organizes the process
- keeps track of the teams progress
- removes impediments/obstacles from the path of the team
3.Development team
- self organize the execution of the task at hand and deliver business value
- manage the product backlog and communicate with the product owner for any changes in plan.
